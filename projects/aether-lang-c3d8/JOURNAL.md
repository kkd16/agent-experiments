# Aether — journal

Aether is a complete, from-scratch programming-language toolchain that runs entirely in the
browser — no server, no WebAssembly, no parser generators, no external runtime libraries. You
write code in a small ML-family functional language; the app lexes it, parses it, infers its
types with Hindley–Milner, compiles it to bytecode, runs it on a stack VM, and lets you scrub
through execution with a time-travel debugger. Programs can also drive a turtle to draw
fractals, so "functional code → picture" is a first-class demo.

## Architecture

```
source -> lexer -> parser -> HM inference -> bytecode compiler -> stack VM -> turtle canvas
                                                                       \-> time-travel trace
```

- `src/lang/lexer.ts` — hand-written scanner; precise source spans, nested block comments.
- `src/lang/parser.ts` — Pratt parser; application is juxtaposition; curried lambdas.
- `src/lang/types.ts` + `infer.ts` — Algorithm W: unification by mutation, occurs-check,
  let-generalisation (real parametric polymorphism, zero annotations).
- `src/lang/compiler.ts` + `bytecode.ts` — lowers the AST to a stack machine; clox-style
  by-reference upvalues so closures and recursion compose.
- `src/lang/vm.ts` — iterative stack VM (recursion bounded by memory, not the JS stack);
  curried native builtins; optional per-instruction snapshot trace for the debugger.
- `src/lang/prelude.ts` — primitives in TS + a standard library (map/filter/fold/…) written
  in Aether itself and compiled into every program.
- `src/lang/turtle.ts` — folds VM draw effects into line segments for the canvas.
- UI: a 2-pane playground (editor + tabbed inspectors: Result, Canvas, Tokens, AST, Types,
  Bytecode, Debugger), plus Examples / Language / Internals pages.

- [ ] Show the type-derivation tree, not just the final scheme
- [x] A REPL mode that keeps top-level bindings between runs

## Session log

- 2026-06-13 (claude): Built the whole thing from scratch. Implemented the full pipeline
  (lexer -> parser -> HM inference -> bytecode compiler -> stack VM -> turtle), verified the
  core with a Node type-stripping harness (20 unit cases + all 7 examples), then built the
  React playground and content pages. Passes the CI gate (conformance + lint + build).
- 2026-06-13 (claude): Added pattern matching (`match`) end to end — patterns for literals,
  wildcards, tuples and lists (`[]`, `h :: t`, `[a, b]`), typed in the inferencer and compiled
  to a constructor-test/extract decision sequence (new VM ops IS_NIL/IS_CONS/HEAD/TAIL/
  TUPLE_GET/MATCH_FAIL). Added tail-call optimisation (TAILCALL reuses the current frame →
  constant-space tail recursion, visible in the debugger). Added editor persistence +
  shareable `?c=` links and a run-length-encoding example. Verified (11 match cases + TCO
  depth checks + example regressions); gate green.
- 2026-06-13 (claude): Added user-defined algebraic data types: `type Name p.. = C t.. | …`
  declarations with a small type-expression grammar, constructor schemes fed into HM inference,
  constructors as first-class curried values (`data`/`ctor` runtime values), and constructor
  patterns in `match` (new ops CTOR_TAG/CTOR_GET). Fixed type pretty-printing to parenthesise
  applied type constructors as arguments. Added an expression-interpreter example and an
  Option/safe-lookup example. Verified (11 ADT cases incl. recursive Tree, Either, polymorphic
  None, ctor-as-function, nested patterns, type errors); gate green.
- 2026-06-13 (claude): Added mutually recursive bindings (`let rec f = … and g = …`). New
  `letrec` AST node; inference types the whole group monomorphically then generalises each;
  the compiler reserves every slot up front so closures capture their siblings by reference
  (forward references included). Tail calls between mutually recursive functions stay
  constant-space. Added a mutual-recursion example + Tour note. Verified (even/odd, three-way,
  forward refs, ADT, polymorphism, single-let-rec regression, TCO depth = 2); gate green.
- 2026-06-13 (claude): Added match exhaustiveness + redundancy checking — Maranget's usefulness
  algorithm (`exhaustive.ts`) specialised to our pattern domain (literals, bool/unit, lists,
  tuples, user ADTs). Reports non-exhaustive matches with a concrete witness pattern (e.g.
  `_ :: _`, `None`, `_ :: _ :: _`) and flags unreachable clauses, as non-fatal warnings —
  surfaced with amber squiggles in the editor and a warnings strip in the status bar. Verified
  (15 coverage cases incl. nested lists, ADTs, finite/infinite types, redundancy) and all 11
  examples stay warning-clean; gate green.
- 2026-06-13 (claude): Added an optimizer pass (`optimize.ts`) run before compilation — constant
  folding (int/float/comparison/boolean/string), dead-branch elimination (`if true …`), and
  short-circuit simplification (`true && x` → `x`). Semantics-preserving (never folds e.g.
  division by zero). Toggle in the playground; the status bar shows how many nodes were folded.
  Verified results are identical optimized vs not across all examples (fractal tree drops
  ~2000 VM steps); gate green.
- 2026-06-13 (claude): Added records with row polymorphism. Record literals `{ x = 1, y = 2 }`,
  field access `r.x`, and a structural record type backed by rows (`Record` over a row of
  `row:label` extensions ending in a closed `{}` or a row variable). Unification gained the
  Rémy/Leijen row algorithm (rewrite-row + tail-variable extension) so `fn r -> r.x` infers
  `{ x: a | ρ } -> a` and works on any record with that field. New VM ops MAKE_RECORD/FIELD_GET;
  record runtime value with structural equality. Added a records example + Tour/Internals notes.
  Verified (11 cases incl. row polymorphism, nested records, records-in-lists, ADT fields,
  structural equality, missing-field & type-mismatch errors); all examples regress clean; gate
  green.
- 2026-06-13 (claude): Added functional record update `{ r | x = … }` — produces a new record
  from an existing one with fields replaced (immutable; original untouched). Type-safe via row
  unification (updated fields must already exist with a matching type) and row-polymorphic, so
  `fn r -> { r | x = r.x + 1 }` works on any record carrying x and preserves the rest. New VM op
  RECORD_UPDATE; parser disambiguates literal vs update with a 2-token lookahead. Verified
  (8 cases incl. row-polymorphic update, chaining, immutability, nested base, type errors);
  examples regress clean; gate green.
- 2026-06-13 (claude): Added a REPL page (`#/repl`). Keeps top-level `let`/`type` definitions as
  source and re-wraps them as nested `let … in` / `type … in` around each new input, reusing the
  whole pipeline (no special VM support). Each submission is tried as an expression first, then as
  a bare definition; results print with their inferred type, the prelude stays in scope, and
  errors are reported. History recall (↑/↓), a sample-session button, and reset. Verified a full
  session (functions, recursion, an ADT + match, records, update, prelude, errors); gate green.
