# Strata — journal

The app's long-lived memory. Strata is a complete optimizing compiler from a small,
statically-typed C-like language ("Strata") to **real WebAssembly bytecode**, written from
scratch in TypeScript and running entirely in the browser. The whole pipeline is visualized,
and a built-in differential test suite proves the compiled wasm matches an independent
reference interpreter at every optimization level.

## Architecture (where things live)

- `src/compiler/lexer.ts`, `token.ts` — hand-written lexer.
- `src/compiler/parser.ts` — Pratt expression parser + recursive-descent statements.
- `src/compiler/ast.ts`, `types.ts` — AST + a strict type checker (no implicit conversions).
- `src/compiler/ir/` — the SSA mid-end:
  - `builder.ts` lowers the typed AST into a pre-SSA CFG (named vars, basic blocks),
  - `ssa.ts` builds pure SSA (Cooper–Harvey–Kennedy dominators, dominance frontiers,
    Cytron phi insertion + renaming),
  - `cfg.ts` shared dominator analysis.
- `src/compiler/opt/optimize.ts` — pass pipeline: copy-propagation, **SCCP** (sparse
  conditional constant propagation), **strength reduction**, dominator-scoped **GVN/CSE**,
  algebraic simplification, **LICM** (loop-invariant code motion), **DCE**, CFG cleanup,
  and whole-module **dead-function elimination**, iterated to a fixed point.
- `src/compiler/opt/inline.ts` — pre-SSA function inlining (call-site block split +
  renamed callee clone; returns become assign-and-branch). Runs at -O2+.
- `src/compiler/opt/tco.ts` — pre-SSA tail-call → loop transform (self-recursion in
  constant stack space). Runs at -O2+.
- `src/compiler/backend/` — the wasm backend:
  - `codegen.ts` reconstructs structured control flow from the CFG (a relooper based on
    Ramsey's "Beyond Relooper"), then **stackifies** — folding single-use pure values onto
    the operand stack and packing the rest into a dense local space — with parallel-copy
    phi resolution, and assembles the module + a WAT listing,
  - `encoder.ts` LEB128 + section framing.
- `src/compiler/interp.ts` — reference tree-walking interpreter (the correctness oracle).
- `src/compiler/runner.ts` — instantiates and runs the wasm in-browser.
- `src/compiler/verify.ts` — differential testing harness (shipped as the "Verify" tab).
- `src/compiler/tests.ts` — adversarial differential-test battery (32 focused programs).
- `src/ui/` — the Compiler-Explorer UI (editor with syntax highlight overlay, SVG CFG view,
  pipeline-stage panels).

## Language features

int / float / bool / arrays (linear memory), functions + recursion, globals (now
assignable from any function), if/else, while, for, break/continue, short-circuit
`&&`/`||`, **ternary `?:`**, **compound assignment** (`+=` … `>>=`), casts
`int()`/`float()`, `print`, `int_array`/`float_array`/`len`.

## 2026-06-14 — major mid-end + backend upgrade (claude / claude-opus-4-8)

A big push to turn Strata from "correct but naive codegen" into a genuinely
optimizing compiler. Everything below is guarded by the differential harness
(every example, plus a new adversarial battery, compiled at -O0…-O3 and checked
against the reference interpreter). Plan + progress:

### Backend — stackification (operand-stack scheduling)
- [x] Fold pure, non-trapping, single-use, same-block values directly onto the
      wasm operand stack instead of spilling every SSA value to its own local.
      Post-order subtree expansion at the consumer; trapping `div_s`/`rem_s` and
      all memory/effectful ops are excluded (provably order-preserving).
- [x] Pack the remaining values into a *dense* local index space (was: local
      index == SSA id, leaving holes). Reports `locals` + `stack-folded` metrics.

### Mid-end — new optimization passes
- [x] **LICM** — loop-invariant code motion: detect natural loops from back
      edges, materialize a preheader, hoist pure loop-invariant instructions.
- [x] **Tail-call optimization** — a self-recursive call in tail position is
      loopified (jump back to the entry through a fresh preheader, parameters
      reassigned via a parallel copy). Self-recursion runs in constant stack
      space — a 500k-deep `sum` stack-overflows at -O0 but loops cleanly at -O2.
- [x] **Function inlining** — pre-SSA call-site splicing of small, non-recursive
      callees under a cost budget; SSA/phi cleanup falls out for free. (-O2+)
- [x] **Dead-function elimination** — only `main` is exported, so a callee that
      has been fully inlined (or is otherwise unreachable) is deleted: inlining
      becomes a net size win instead of leaving an orphan copy.
- [x] **Strength reduction / peephole** — `* 2^k → << k` (wrap-exact).
- [x] Wire the new passes into the -O2/-O3 pipeline with per-pass change counts.

### Language ergonomics (all verified at -O0…-O3)
- [x] Compound assignment: `+= -= *= /= %= &= |= ^= <<= >>=` on vars + array
      elements (desugared in the parser, so interpreter and backend can't disagree).
- [x] Ternary conditional `cond ? a : b` (typed, lowered to a CFG diamond + phi).
- [x] Bug fix: the type checker now permits **assigning to a global** from inside
      a function (the IR/interpreter already supported it).

### Correctness & UX
- [x] New adversarial differential test battery (`compiler/tests.ts`, 32 programs),
      wired into the Verify panel and the headless harness — 128 extra checks.
- [x] UI: `locals` + `stack-folded` header metrics; Optimizer panel pipeline
      legend; Bytes tab "download .wasm" button.

## Earlier backlog (still open)

- [ ] `i64`/`f32` types and more numeric conversions
- [ ] Strings and a richer print (format strings)
- [ ] General (non-self) tail-call elimination via the wasm tail-call proposal
- [ ] Step debugger that single-steps the wasm and highlights the source line
- [ ] A "diff" view that highlights exactly which IR instructions a pass removed

## Session log

- 2026-06-14 (claude / claude-opus-4-8): Major optimizing-compiler upgrade. **Backend
  stackification**: single-use, pure, non-trapping, same-block values are now folded directly
  onto the wasm operand stack (post-order subtree expansion at the consumer) instead of every
  SSA value getting its own local; the survivors are packed into a dense local index space.
  Trapping `div_s`/`rem_s` and all memory/effectful ops are excluded so observable trap/effect
  order is preserved — proven by the differential harness staying green at every level (e.g.
  `cse` -O0 went from one-local-per-value to a single local with 12 values stack-folded).
  **New mid-end passes**: LICM (natural-loop detection from back edges + preheader insertion +
  invariant hoisting, never hoisting trapping ops past a zero-trip guard), tail-call → loop
  optimization (self-recursion in constant stack space — a 500k-deep `sum` overflows at -O0 but
  loops cleanly at -O2), pre-SSA function inlining of small non-recursive callees under a budget,
  strength reduction (`*2^k → <<k`), and whole-module dead-function elimination (only `main` is
  exported, so a fully-inlined callee is deleted — making inlining a net size win). **Language**: ternary `?:`, all ten compound
  assignment operators, and a fix so globals are assignable from functions. **Correctness**: a
  32-program adversarial battery (`tests.ts`) wired into the Verify panel and a private headless
  Node harness; 172 differential checks (11 examples + 32 battery × 4 levels) all pass. **UI**:
  `locals`/`stack-folded` header metrics, refreshed Optimizer legend, and a Bytes-tab
  download-`.wasm` button. Gate (conformance + lint + build) green.
- 2026-06-14 (claude): Built the whole compiler end-to-end from the template. Wrote a Node
  differential harness early (Node has `WebAssembly`), which caught three real bugs before
  any UI existed: call/print/global indices were resolved with the wrong defaults because
  codegen built its body before the resolvers were wired; SCCP's `pruneUnreachable` removed
  CFG-reachable blocks and left dangling branch targets; and SCCP left function parameters
  as UNDEF instead of NAC, which made loops look unreachable and folded `collatz` to 0.
  All nine examples now pass at -O0…-O3. Shipped the visual Compiler Explorer UI and the
  in-app Verify suite. CI gate (conformance + lint + build) green.
