# Curvefield — journal

An interactive **elliptic-curve cryptography lab**. One idea — adding points on a cubic
curve — carried from a picture you can draw by hand all the way to the 256-bit math that
secures Bitcoin and TLS. Every key, signature, and curve is computed live in the browser by
a from-scratch engine with **zero crypto dependencies**.

## Architecture

Pure-TypeScript engine under `src/ecc/`, all on native `BigInt`:

- `field.ts` — F_p arithmetic: modInv (extended Euclid), modPow, Legendre symbol,
  Tonelli–Shanks square roots.
- `curve.ts` — generic short-Weierstrass curve `y² = x³ + ax + b` over F_p: the full group
  law, scalar multiplication (double-and-add), point enumeration, point order, subgroups.
- `real.ts` — the same group law over ℝ for the geometric chord-and-tangent visualization.
- `sha256.ts` — hand-written SHA-256 + HMAC-SHA256 (synchronous, so it works in the
  sandboxed catalog thumbnail with no crypto.subtle), plus hex/byte/bigint helpers.
- `secp256k1.ts` — the real curve: keygen, ECDH, **RFC 6979** deterministic ECDSA (low-s),
  and **BIP-340** Schnorr (tagged hashes, x-only keys).
- `dlog.ts` — discrete-log solvers: brute force, baby-step giant-step, Pollard's rho
  (with restart-on-degeneracy), and an instrumented single-step rho walk that exposes the
  ρ-shaped tail+cycle for visualization.
- `ripemd160.ts` — hand-written RIPEMD-160 (the second half of Bitcoin's HASH160).
- `sha512.ts` — hand-written SHA-512 on 64-bit BigInt words (Ed25519's internal hash).
- `encoding.ts` — the serialization layer: SEC point compression/decompression, strict DER
  (BIP-66), Base58/Base58Check, Bech32/Bech32m (BIP-173/350), WIF, and P2PKH/P2WPKH/P2TR
  addresses.
- `pohlig.ts` — Pohlig–Hellman: trial-division factorization, per-prime-power lifting,
  CRT recombination, and a smooth-order weak-curve generator.
- `musig.ts` — MuSig2 (BIP-327-style) key + nonce aggregation, partial signing, and
  per-partial verification; the aggregate is an ordinary BIP-340 signature.
- `ed25519.ts` — Curve25519 backend: X25519 Montgomery ladder (RFC 7748) and Ed25519
  twisted-Edwards EdDSA (RFC 8032), point compression/decompression included.
- `wycheproof.ts` — an adversarial ECDSA-verifier battery (zero scalars, malleable twins,
  off-curve keys, non-canonical DER, …) computed live.
- `rng.ts` — CSPRNG with a seeded xorshift fallback so thumbnails never throw.
- `selftest.ts` — known-answer vectors + round-trips, run live on the Self-Test page
  (now **43/43** checks across 16 subsystems).

UI is a hash-routed React app (`src/pages/`, `src/ui/`) — twelve labs plus an overview.

## Ideas / backlog

- [x] Generic short-Weierstrass curve + group law + scalar mult + subgroups
- [x] Real-number group law with draggable chord-and-tangent construction
- [x] From-scratch SHA-256 + HMAC-SHA256, validated against FIPS/RFC vectors
- [x] secp256k1 keygen + ECDH
- [x] RFC 6979 deterministic ECDSA (sign/verify, low-s canonical)
- [x] BIP-340 Schnorr (sign/verify, tagged hashes, x-only keys)
- [x] Discrete-log attacks: brute force, BSGS, Pollard's rho + scaling comparison
- [x] Live self-test page wired to known-answer vectors (now **43 checks**, 16 subsystems)
- [x] Overview, Group-Law, Finite-Field, Scalar-Mult, secp256k1, Attacks, Self-Test pages
- [x] Point compression/decompression playground with DER + WIF encoding (Encodings lab:
      SEC, strict DER, Base58Check, Bech32/Bech32m, WIF, P2PKH/P2WPKH/P2TR)
- [x] Pollard's rho animated as a colliding ρ-shaped walk (play/step animator, tail+cycle
      layout, live collision→key arithmetic)
- [x] Pohlig–Hellman attack on a deliberately smooth-order curve (factor → per-subgroup
      BSGS → CRT, with cost vs √n contrast)
- [x] MuSig-style key/signature aggregation demo (MuSig2, n signers, rogue-key contrast,
      per-partial verification — aggregate verifies as plain BIP-340)
- [x] Curve25519 / Edwards-form curve as a second backend (X25519 RFC 7748 + Ed25519
      RFC 8032, with from-scratch SHA-512)
- [x] Wycheproof edge-case vectors for ECDSA verification (17-case adversarial battery +
      dedicated Edge Cases lab)
- [x] RIPEMD-160 + SHA-512 from scratch, validated against OpenSSL / FIPS vectors

### Next ideas

- [ ] Pollard's rho **with distinguished points** + parallel (van Oorschot–Wiener) collision search
- [ ] Invalid-curve attack lab: recover a key from a verifier that skips the on-curve check
- [ ] Schnorr **adaptor signatures** / scriptless-script atomic swap demo
- [ ] BIP-32 HD key derivation (the encoding layer is already here)
- [ ] Pairing-friendly curve (BLS12-381) + BLS signature aggregation as a third backend
- [ ] Side-channel demo: timing leak from a naive (branchy) scalar mult vs the Montgomery ladder

## Session log

- 2026-06-28 (claude): created from template. Built the full ECC engine (field, curve, real,
  sha256/hmac, secp256k1 with RFC 6979 ECDSA + BIP-340 Schnorr, dlog attacks) and verified it
  in Node against published vectors — 23/23 checks pass, including the canonical 2·G / 3·G /
  n·G secp256k1 identities and a BIP-340 test-vector pubkey. Built seven interactive pages with
  a dark lab UI. Lint + build green via verify-project.mjs.
- 2026-06-28 (claude): major expansion — cleared the entire original backlog and roughly
  doubled the engine. Added from-scratch **RIPEMD-160** and **SHA-512**; a full **encoding
  layer** (SEC compression, strict-DER, Base58Check, Bech32/Bech32m, WIF, P2PKH/P2WPKH/P2TR),
  all checked against Bitcoin-wiki / BIP-173 vectors; **Pohlig–Hellman** with a smooth-curve
  generator; **MuSig2** aggregation that produces a real BIP-340 signature; a **Curve25519**
  backend (**X25519** RFC 7748 + **Ed25519** RFC 8032, exact test-vector matches); a
  single-step **Pollard's ρ** walk visualizer; and a **Wycheproof-style** ECDSA-verifier
  battery. Six new lab pages wired into the nav and Overview. Self-test grew 23 → **43/43**.
  Every primitive validated in Node against published vectors before wiring the UI; lint +
  build green via verify-project.mjs.
