        <h1>Helios</h1>
        <p className="tagline">A real-time gravitational N-body studio, in your browser.</p>

        <h2>What you are looking at</h2>
        <p>
          Every glowing point is a body — a star, a clump of dark matter, a planet — moving under
          nothing but Newtonian gravity. There is no scripted animation: positions are integrated
          forward in time from the mutual gravitational pull of all the others.
        </p>

        <h2>Barnes–Hut: O(n log n) gravity</h2>
        <p>
          Computing every pairwise force is O(n²) — hopeless past a few thousand bodies. Helios
          builds a <strong>quadtree</strong> each frame and approximates distant clusters by their
          centre of mass. A node of width <code>s</code> seen at distance <code>d</code> is treated
          as a single point mass when <code>s/d &lt; θ</code>. Turn on <em>Show quadtree</em> to watch
          space subdivide around dense regions, and drag <em>θ</em> to trade accuracy for speed.
        </p>

        <h2>Symplectic integration</h2>
        <p>
          Orbits are a stiff test of numerical integrators. <strong>Velocity Verlet</strong> and{' '}
          <strong>Leapfrog</strong> are <em>symplectic</em>: they conserve a nearby "shadow" energy
          exactly, so the <em>Energy drift</em> trace stays flat for millions of steps. Switch to{' '}
          <strong>Explicit Euler</strong> and watch the same trace ramp away as the system unphysically
          gains energy — then to <strong>RK4</strong>, which is high-order yet still drifts because it
          is not symplectic. The conservation plots are computed independently of the force solver, so
          they are an honest report card.
        </p>

        <h2>Softening</h2>
        <p>
          Point masses produce infinite forces at zero separation. We use{' '}
          <strong>Plummer softening</strong>, replacing <code>1/r²</code> with{' '}
          <code>1/(r² + ε²)</code>. Larger <em>ε</em> yields smoother, more fluid-like dynamics; smaller
          ε resolves tight encounters but demands a smaller timestep.
        </p>

        <h2>Try this</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Load <em>Galaxy Collision</em> and watch tidal tails and bridges form.</li>
          <li>Run <em>Cold Collapse</em> to see violent relaxation build a smooth halo from chaos.</li>
          <li>Switch the integrator to <em>Explicit Euler</em> on any scenario and watch the energy trace climb.</li>
          <li>Set drag mode to <em>Slingshot</em>, crank up the spawn mass, and fling a rogue black hole through a galaxy.</li>
        </ul>
