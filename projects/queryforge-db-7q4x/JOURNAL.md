# QueryForge — journal

An in-browser relational database engine, written from scratch in TypeScript: a real SQL
front-end (lexer → Pratt parser → AST), a cost-based rule optimizer, a Volcano iterator-model
executor, and a B+Tree storage layer — wrapped in a polished SQL IDE with an `EXPLAIN`
plan visualizer and a built-in self-test suite.

## Architecture (where things live)

- `src/db/lexer.ts` — tokenizer (also drives editor syntax highlighting)
- `src/db/parser.ts` — recursive-descent + Pratt expression parser → `ast.ts`
- `src/db/eval.ts` — compiled expression evaluator with SQL three-valued logic + scalar fns
- `src/db/planner.ts` — predicate pushdown, (composite) index selection, index-only &
  bitmap-AND access paths, cost-based join reordering (subset DP), cost-based join &
  selectivity, aggregation (incl. grouping sets), window planning
- `src/db/stats.ts` — column statistics (histograms, MCV, n-distinct) + selectivity estimators
- `src/db/operators.ts` — physical operators (SeqScan/IndexScan/IndexOnlyScan/BitmapAnd/
  Filter/Project/HashJoin/MergeJoin/NestedLoopJoin/Sort with external merge/Distinct/Limit)
  with cost + plan nodes
- `src/db/aggregate.ts` — HashAggregate (COUNT/SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX/STDDEV/VARIANCE/MEDIAN/
  STRING_AGG, DISTINCT, FILTER, GROUP BY) + ROLLUP/CUBE/GROUPING SETS (multi-set, grouping
  bitmap) + ordered-set aggregates (PERCENTILE_CONT/DISC, MODE)
- `src/db/window.ts` — window executor with explicit ROWS/RANGE frames
- `src/db/storage/btree.ts` — a genuine tuple-keyed B+Tree (node splits, chained leaves,
  range scans, key-yielding `rangeKeys` for index-only scans)
- `src/db/csv.ts` — CSV parser + type-inferring CREATE TABLE/INSERT generator
- `src/db/decimal.ts` — first-class exact numerics: DECIMAL/NUMERIC as a tagged,
  JSON-serializable value `{t:'decimal', d, s}` (unscaled BigInt rendered to a
  string + a scale). BigInt arithmetic (add/sub/mul/div/mod, round/trunc/floor/
  ceil, rescale), exact comparison, canonical hashing, parse/format, and
  Postgres-style numeric `TO_CHAR` template formatting.
- `src/db/temporal.ts` — first-class DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP/INTERVAL values: tagged
  (JSON-serializable) representation, parse/format, compare/order/hash, calendar-aware
  arithmetic, and EXTRACT/DATE_TRUNC/AGE
- `src/db/catalog.ts` — tables (heaps), single/composite indexes, constraints, stats cache, snapshots
- `src/db/engine.ts` — top-level: DDL/DML/SELECT/EXPLAIN + snapshot transactions
- `src/db/tests.ts` — 143 engine self-tests (run head-less in CI and in the Self-tests tab)
- `src/ui/*` — the IDE: editor, results grid, schema browser, plan tree, docs

- [x] Expanded self-test suite (69 cases) + Reference / Internals / sample-query refresh + CSV export

### v2.0 — statistics-driven planning + new operators + analytics UI

- [x] Tuple-keyed B+Tree + composite (multi-column) indexes; planner matches an equality prefix + one trailing range
- [x] Table & column statistics (row/distinct/null counts, min/max, equi-depth histograms + MCV) via `ANALYZE`, auto-gathered on demand and invalidated on mutation
- [x] Cost-based selectivity: histogram range/equality/IN/BETWEEN/IS NULL estimates wired into every operator's `estRows` and the Filter selectivity
- [x] Sort–merge join operator + cost-based choice between hash join and merge join (large, balanced inputs)
- [x] External (run-generating, k-way) merge sort with spill reporting in `EXPLAIN`
- [x] Explicit window frames: `ROWS|RANGE BETWEEN … AND …` (UNBOUNDED / N PRECEDING / CURRENT ROW / N FOLLOWING)
- [x] Set-operation & recursive-CTE column type unification by position (INTEGER+REAL→REAL, anything+TEXT→TEXT)
- [x] New aggregates: `STDDEV`/`STDDEV_POP`/`VARIANCE`/`VAR_POP`, `STRING_AGG`/`GROUP_CONCAT`, `MEDIAN`
- [x] CSV import panel (paste or file upload) with type inference → `CREATE TABLE` + bulk `INSERT`
- [x] Result chart view — from-scratch SVG bar & line charts over any rows result
- [x] Surface stats in the schema browser + a "Statistics" stage in Internals; refreshed Reference & samples
- [x] Aggregate `FILTER (WHERE …)` clause (e.g. `COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE …)`)
- [x] Grew the self-test suite from 69 → 93 cases covering every new feature

### v3.0 — the analytics & optimizer release (shipped this session)

- [x] **Ordered-set aggregates** — `PERCENTILE_CONT(f)`, `PERCENTILE_DISC(f)` and `MODE()`
  via `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY …)` (interpolated percentile, discrete percentile, modal value)
- [x] **Multidimensional grouping** — `GROUP BY ROLLUP(…)`, `CUBE(…)` and explicit
  `GROUPING SETS ((…), ())`, expanded as the cross product of grouping elements and executed
  as a single multi-set HashAggregate carrying a per-row grouping bitmap
- [x] **`GROUPING(col, …)`** — flags which columns a row rolled up (works in SELECT/HAVING/ORDER BY)
- [x] **Cost-based join reordering** — a Selinger-style left-deep subset DP searches INNER-join
  orders and keeps the cheapest; a transparent permuting projection preserves `SELECT *` column
  order, and it falls back to written order for outer joins or any unplaceable predicate
- [x] **Index-only (covering) scans** — when an index holds every column a single-table query
  needs, answer straight from the B+Tree leaves (`rangeKeys`) and never touch the heap
- [x] **Bitmap-AND scans** — intersect the row-id sets of several single-column indexes for a
  multi-predicate filter, then heap-fetch in physical order (a composite index still wins ties)
- [x] Grew the self-test suite 93 → 113 and refreshed the Reference / Internals docs + 6 new
  sample queries (ROLLUP/CUBE, percentiles, index-only, bitmap-AND, join-reorder EXPLAINs)

### v3.1 — IN-lists, GROUPING_ID & VALUES (shipped this session)

- [x] **Bitmap OR scans** — `WHERE col IN (…)` over an indexed column unions per-value index
  lookups into one bitmap instead of a sequential scan (the OR counterpart to BitmapAnd)
- [x] **`GROUPING_ID(a, b, …)`** — the combined grouping bitmap as a single integer
- [x] **`VALUES` constructor** — top-level `VALUES (…), (…)` and `FROM (VALUES …) AS t(cols)`,
  desugared to a UNION-ALL of constant SELECTs (so set-op type unification just works)
- [x] **Derived-table column aliases** — `FROM (SELECT …) t (c1, c2)` renames the output columns
- [x] Grew the self-test suite 113 → 120; refreshed docs + 2 new sample queries

### v4.0 — First-class temporal types (DATE / TIME / TIMESTAMP / INTERVAL) ✅

Planned and shipped as one coherent release. The hard part was doing it without
inflating the runtime value space (everything must still serialize to localStorage):
temporal values are **plain tagged objects** that survive a JSON round-trip, and a single
set of helpers makes them flow through every existing subsystem (indexes, sort, group,
join, stats) for free.

- [x] **Temporal value module** (`db/temporal.ts`) — `{t:'date',days}` / `{t:'time',ms}` /
  `{t:'timestamp',ms}` / `{t:'interval',months,days,ms}`, all UTC, with parse, format,
  compare/order/hash and conversions
- [x] **Core value-system integration** — widen `ColumnType` + `SqlValue`; teach
  `valueTypeOf`/`coerceTo`/`compareValues`/`orderValues`/`hashKey`/`formatValue` about temporals
  (so a string counterpart coerces: `d = '2026-06-15'` works)
- [x] **Typed literals** — `DATE '…'`, `TIME '…'`, `TIMESTAMP '…'`, `INTERVAL '…'`
  (phrase + clock-segment interval grammar), disambiguated from the `DATE(x)` function
- [x] **Column types + CAST** — `CREATE TABLE … d DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP/INTERVAL`,
  `CAST(x AS DATE)` and friends; INSERT coerces strings into the declared type
- [x] **Calendar-aware arithmetic** — `date+interval→timestamp`, `date+int→date`,
  `date−date→int`, `timestamp−timestamp→interval`, `interval ±/∗ …`, unary `−interval`;
  month addition clamps the day-of-month (Jan 31 + 1 month → Feb 28, leap-year aware)
- [x] **`EXTRACT(field FROM x)`** (standard spelling) + `DATE_PART`, covering
  year…second, dow/isodow/doy/week/quarter/decade/century/epoch, and interval fields
- [x] **`DATE_TRUNC`, `AGE`, `MAKE_DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP/INTERVAL`, `TO_DATE/TO_TIMESTAMP`,
  niladic `CURRENT_DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP`**
- [x] **It just works downstream** — temporal columns ORDER BY, GROUP BY, DISTINCT, join,
  drive B+Tree index scans and feed histograms; values render in the grid + CSV export
- [x] **Showcase** — a `subscriptions` table (DATE/INTERVAL/TIMESTAMP) in the seed + 3 sample
  queries; refreshed Reference (new "Temporal types" section) and Internals (a value-system stage)
- [x] **Tests** — grew the suite 120 → 143 (23 new temporal tests incl. a persistence round-trip),
  all green via `verify-project.mjs`

### v5.0 — Declarative integrity: keys, checks, defaults & foreign keys ✅

The headline gap for a "real" relational engine: it could *describe* data richly but couldn't
*constrain* it. v5.0 makes integrity first-class and, crucially, **declarative** — you state the
rules in DDL and the engine enforces them on every write, cascading across tables as configured.
The design principle that kept it clean: per-row rules (NOT NULL / CHECK / UNIQUE) live on the
`Table`; cross-table rules (FOREIGN KEY + referential actions) are orchestrated by the `Database`,
which owns every table and so can cascade between them — and **statement atomicity** (snapshot +
rollback-on-throw) means a half-applied cascade or a row-50-of-100 violation can never leave a
partial state, so the enforcement code never has to unwind by hand.

- [x] **CHECK constraints** — column- and table-level `CHECK (expr)`, compiled to the same closure
  form as any predicate and run on INSERT/UPDATE; violated only when the result is FALSE (a NULL
  result passes, per SQL). Named constraints report their name.
- [x] **DEFAULT values** — `col TYPE DEFAULT expr` (literals, signed numbers, `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`,
  …) fill omitted columns on INSERT and feed `ON … SET DEFAULT`.
- [x] **Composite PRIMARY KEY & UNIQUE** — table-level `PRIMARY KEY (a, b)` / `UNIQUE (a, b)`,
  enforced by one UNIQUE B+Tree over the tuple; PK columns become implicitly NOT NULL; a UNIQUE
  key with any NULL component never collides. UNIQUE is now enforced on UPDATE too (excluding self).
- [x] **FOREIGN KEY + referential actions** — column- and table-level `REFERENCES parent(cols)`
  with `ON DELETE` / `ON UPDATE` `NO ACTION | RESTRICT | CASCADE | SET NULL | SET DEFAULT`.
  Child writes verify the parent exists (MATCH SIMPLE — a NULL key is exempt); parent delete/update
  drives the action across dependents, **recursively** (self-referential trees included) and
  depth-guarded against cycles. FK targets must be PRIMARY KEY/UNIQUE; a referenced table can't be
  dropped.
- [x] **Statement atomicity** — every INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DDL snapshots first and rolls back
  wholesale on any throw, so a partly-failing bulk insert or a RESTRICT-blocked cascade is a no-op.
- [x] **ALTER TABLE** — `ADD [COLUMN]` (backfilling existing rows with the DEFAULT),
  `ADD [CONSTRAINT n] CHECK/UNIQUE/FOREIGN KEY` (validated against current data before taking
  effect), `RENAME TO` / `RENAME COLUMN` (updating referencing FKs), and guarded `DROP COLUMN`.
- [x] **Constraints persist** — snapshot/restore (now v3) round-trips PK/UNIQUE/CHECK/DEFAULT/FK,
  so integrity survives a reload and a transaction rollback rebuilds it.
- [x] **UI + docs** — the schema browser shows FK arrows (→ parent, with action tags), CHECK
  expressions, DEFAULT values and composite PKs; the seed gains real FK relationships
  (orders→customers ON DELETE CASCADE, orders→products ON DELETE RESTRICT, subscriptions→customers)
  plus CHECKs/DEFAULTs; 3 new sample queries (a cascade-in-a-transaction, what gets rejected, and an
  ALTER walkthrough); a new Reference section and an Internals pipeline stage.
- [x] **Tests** — grew the suite 143 → 173 (30 new cases across CHECK, DEFAULT, composite PK/UNIQUE,
  every referential action, multi-column & self-referential FKs, atomicity, ALTER and a
  constraint persistence round-trip); `verify-project.mjs` green.

### v6.0 — First-class exact numerics (DECIMAL / NUMERIC) ✅

The other half of "more types" (temporal was v4.0): money and any value that must
be **exact**. The design mirrors temporal exactly — a single new tagged value that
flows through the whole engine by teaching the six central value functions about it,
so it indexes, sorts, groups, joins, aggregates and persists for free. The one twist
was serialization: a `BigInt` can't be `JSON.stringify`'d, so a DECIMAL stores its
unscaled integer as a **string** (`{t:'decimal', d:'-1999', s:2}` = -19.99) and lifts
it back to `BigInt` for arithmetic — keeping the localStorage round-trip intact while
arithmetic stays arbitrary-precision and exact.

- [x] **`db/decimal.ts`** — BigInt-backed value module: parse/format, exact
  `+ − × ÷ %`, `round`/`trunc`/`floor`/`ceil`/`rescale`/`abs`/`neg`/`sign`,
  scale-independent compare, canonical hashing, precision, and a numeric
  `TO_CHAR` template engine.
- [x] **Value-system integration** — widened `ColumnType` (+`DECIMAL`) and `SqlValue`;
  taught `valueTypeOf`/`coerceTo`/`compareValues`/`orderValues`/`hashKey`/`formatValue`
  about decimals, so `1.50 = 1.5 = 2 = the integer-equal value` all share one identity
  and a decimal indexes / sorts / groups / joins like any column.
- [x] **Literals & types** — `DECIMAL '…'` / `NUMERIC '…'` / `DEC '…'` typed literals
  (with exponent), `DECIMAL(precision, scale)` column types and `CAST(x AS DECIMAL(p,s))`,
  rounding to the declared scale on store / cast (half-up). `NUMERIC` / `DEC` aliases.
- [x] **Exact arithmetic with documented scale rules** — `+/−` → max scale, `×` → sum of
  scales, `÷` → ≥ 6 fractional digits (half-up), `÷0` → NULL. Exact against DECIMAL/INTEGER;
  a non-integer REAL degrades the expression to floating point (Postgres `numeric` vs `double`).
- [x] **Exact aggregates** — `SUM`/`AVG` over a DECIMAL stay exact (a money SUM never loses a
  cent); MIN/MAX/MEDIAN/percentiles and the **window** `SUM/AVG OVER` paths all handle decimals.
- [x] **Exact scalar functions** — `ABS/SIGN/ROUND/TRUNC/CEIL/FLOOR/MOD` keep a DECIMAL exact
  (incl. `ROUND(x, −n)`); new `TO_NUMBER`, `DECIMAL(x[,scale])`, `SCALE`, `PRECISION`; `TYPEOF`
  reports `'decimal'`.
- [x] **`TO_CHAR` numeric templates** — `9 0 . , (D G) S MI PR $ L FM` and `#`-on-overflow,
  e.g. `TO_CHAR(1234.5,'FM$999,999.00') → $1,234.50` (the existing temporal `TO_CHAR` still works).
- [x] **Stats & indexes** — histogram/MCV/ndistinct estimators read decimals (exact key + numeric
  position); B+Tree indexes them via the shared total order with zero new code.
- [x] **Showcase** — an `invoices` table with `DECIMAL(12,2)` money + `DECIMAL(5,4)` tax columns in
  the seed; 4 new sample queries (exact totals, float-vs-decimal, recomputed tax = stored total, a
  TO_CHAR currency report); a Reference section, an Internals stage, and `DECIMAL(p,s)` in the schema browser.
- [x] **Tests** — grew the suite 173 → 190 (16 decimal cases + a new "every sample query runs against
  the seed" guard + an invoices integrity check); `verify-project.mjs` green.

### Backlog / next steps

- [ ] **DECIMAL division scale à la Postgres** — `select_div_scale` (derive rscale from operand
  precisions) instead of the fixed `max(s1,s2,6)`; expose a `SET extra_float_digits`-style knob.
- [ ] **Overflow vs. declared precision** — currently DECIMAL(p,s) only enforces *scale*; enforce
  `precision` (digit count) and raise a "numeric field overflow" instead of silently storing.
- [ ] **`SUM`/`AVG` `DECIMAL` window with explicit RANGE frames over decimals** (the running/ROWS
  frames are exact; verify RANGE-frame peer arithmetic on decimals).
- [ ] **CSV import → infer DECIMAL** for fixed-point money columns (today they infer REAL).
- [ ] **`ROUND`/`TO_CHAR` rounding modes** — half-even (banker's) option alongside half-up.

- [ ] **DEFERRABLE constraints + a real multi-statement transaction FK check** (currently MATCH
  SIMPLE, immediate); `MATCH FULL`/`MATCH PARTIAL`
- [ ] **DECIMAL / exact numerics** — the other half of the "more types" item (temporal is done)
- [ ] **`TO_CHAR(temporal, fmt)`** — Postgres-style template formatting (we ship `STRFTIME`)
- [ ] **Time zones** — everything is UTC today; add `TIMESTAMPTZ` + `AT TIME ZONE`
- [ ] **`PERCENTILE_CONT` as a window function** (`… WITHIN GROUP … OVER (PARTITION BY …)`)
- [ ] **Better join cardinality** — estimate equijoin output as `|L|·|R| / max(V(L),V(R))`
  using per-key distinct-value counts, so a selective dimension filter propagates through the
  join (the current `max(|L|,|R|)` model under-rewards reordering)
- [ ] **Bushy / right-deep plans** — let the DP consider non-left-deep shapes and index-nested-loop
  joins (probe a B+Tree per outer row) so a tiny driver can exploit the inner side's index
- [ ] **Index-only scans across joins** — collect per-relation covering sets in multi-table
  queries, not just single-table ones
- [ ] **Bitmap OR + mixed AND/OR** — bitmap-union for `a = 1 OR a = 2`, and combine AND/OR trees
  into a single bitmap heap scan
- [ ] **MATERIALIZED / inlined CTEs** — cost-based choice to inline a non-recursive CTE instead
  of always materializing it; share a CTE referenced multiple times
- [ ] **`GROUPING_ID()` + `HAVING` push-through** for grouping-set queries
- [ ] **Hash aggregation spill** — partition + spill the aggregate hash table past a threshold,
  mirroring the external sort (and report it in EXPLAIN)
- [ ] **Streaming (non-blocking) operators** — make HashJoin/HashAggregate yield incrementally so
  `LIMIT` short-circuits big pipelines
- [ ] **Foreign keys + referential actions**, and a `VALUES` table constructor in FROM
- [ ] **Plan cache** — key parsed+planned queries so repeated statements skip planning

## Session log

- 2026-06-15 (claude / claude-opus-4-8): **v6.0 — first-class exact numerics (DECIMAL / NUMERIC).**
  Added the other half of the "more types" backlog item. Built `db/decimal.ts`: a BigInt-backed
  exact-decimal value stored as a tagged, JSON-serializable object `{t:'decimal', d, s}` (the
  unscaled integer is a BigInt *rendered to a string*, since BigInt itself can't be serialized —
  the trick that keeps the whole DB localStorage-round-trippable while arithmetic stays
  arbitrary-precision). Threaded it through the six central value functions exactly like temporal,
  so a decimal indexes, sorts, GROUP BYs, joins, aggregates and persists for free, and
  `1.50 = 1.5 = 2` share one hash identity. On top: typed literals (`DECIMAL/NUMERIC/DEC '…'`),
  `DECIMAL(p,s)` columns + `CAST` (rounding to scale on store, half-up), exact `+ − × ÷ %` with
  documented scale rules (÷ to ≥6 digits, ÷0→NULL, REAL contaminates to float), exact `SUM`/`AVG`
  in both the GROUP BY and window paths (money SUMs never lose a cent), decimal-exact
  `ABS/SIGN/ROUND/TRUNC/CEIL/FLOOR/MOD` + new `TO_NUMBER/DECIMAL()/SCALE/PRECISION`, and a
  Postgres-style **numeric `TO_CHAR`** template engine (`9 0 . , S MI PR $ L FM`, `#` overflow).
  Stats estimators and the B+Tree pick decimals up via the shared order/hash with ~no new code.
  Showcased with an `invoices` table (DECIMAL money + tax) in the seed, 4 sample queries, a
  Reference section, an Internals stage, and `DECIMAL(p,s)` in the schema browser. Grew the
  self-test suite 173 → 190 (decimal arithmetic/scale/comparison/coercion/aggregates/windows/index/
  rounding/TO_CHAR/persistence + a guard that every shipped sample query runs against the seed);
  verified headless and with `verify-project.mjs` (scope + conformance + lint + build), all green.
- 2026-06-15 (claude / claude-opus-4-8): **v5.0 — declarative integrity.** Added the engine's
  missing half: constraints. CHECK (column + table level, compiled like any predicate, NULL passes),
  DEFAULT (fills omitted columns + feeds SET DEFAULT), composite PRIMARY KEY / UNIQUE (one B+Tree over
  the tuple; PK ⇒ NOT NULL; UNIQUE now enforced on UPDATE), and FOREIGN KEY with the full set of
  `ON DELETE`/`ON UPDATE` actions (NO ACTION/RESTRICT/CASCADE/SET NULL/SET DEFAULT). The clean split:
  the `Table` owns per-row rules, the `Database` owns cross-table referential integrity (it can see
  every table, so it cascades and validates parents); cascades recurse and are depth-guarded for
  self-referential trees/cycles. Made every mutating statement **atomic** — snapshot first, restore on
  any throw — so a partly-failing bulk insert or a RESTRICT-blocked cascade is a clean no-op, which
  meant the integrity code never had to unwind by hand. Bonus: full **ALTER TABLE** (ADD COLUMN with
  DEFAULT backfill; ADD CHECK/UNIQUE/FOREIGN KEY validated against current rows; RENAME TABLE/COLUMN
  updating referencing FKs; guarded DROP COLUMN). Extended snapshots to v3 so constraints round-trip
  (persistence + rollback rebuild them). Surfaced it all in the schema browser (FK arrows with action
  tags, CHECK/DEFAULT/composite-PK), wired real FKs+CHECKs into the seed, added 3 sample queries and
  refreshed Reference/Internals. Grew the self-test suite 143 → 173 (30 new cases); verified headless
  (every test + every sample query against the seed) and with `verify-project.mjs` (scope + conformance
  + lint + build), all green.
- 2026-06-15 (claude / claude-opus-4-8): **v4.0 — first-class temporal types.** Added DATE,
  TIME, TIMESTAMP and INTERVAL as a real part of the value system rather than ISO text. The key
  design choice that kept the engine simple: temporal values are **plain tagged objects**
  (`{t:'date',days}`, `{t:'timestamp',ms}`, `{t:'interval',months,days,ms}`, all UTC) that
  `JSON.stringify`/`parse` round-trip untouched, so a table of dates still serializes to
  localStorage with zero special-casing. A new `db/temporal.ts` owns parsing, formatting,
  comparison/ordering/hashing, calendar arithmetic and EXTRACT/DATE_TRUNC/AGE; threading those
  through the six central value functions in `types.ts` (`valueTypeOf`/`coerceTo`/`compareValues`/
  `orderValues`/`hashKey`/`formatValue`) made temporals work end-to-end — they index in the
  B+Tree, sort, GROUP BY, DISTINCT, join, feed histograms and render in the grid/CSV with no
  per-feature work. On top: typed literals (`DATE '…'` … `INTERVAL '1 year 2 months'` with a
  phrase+clock grammar), the `DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP/INTERVAL` column types + `CAST`, the
  `EXTRACT(field FROM x)` spelling, niladic `CURRENT_DATE/TIME/TIMESTAMP`, and calendar-aware
  arithmetic (`date+interval→timestamp`, `date−date→int`, `ts−ts→interval`, month addition that
  clamps the day-of-month, leap-year aware). Added a `subscriptions` seed table + 3 sample
  queries, a "Temporal types" Reference section and a value-system Internals stage. Grew the
  suite 120 → 143 (23 new tests, incl. a persistence round-trip); `verify-project.mjs` green
  (scope + conformance + lint + build).
- 2026-06-14 (claude / claude-opus-4-8): **v3.1 — IN-lists, GROUPING_ID & VALUES.** Added a
  `BitmapOr` operator that unions per-value index lookups so `WHERE col IN (…)` uses the index
  (folded into the same `chooseIndexAccess` that picks single/composite/bitmap-AND paths by
  predicate count). Added `GROUPING_ID(a, b, …)` (the combined grouping bitmap) alongside
  `GROUPING`. Added the `VALUES` row-set constructor — both as a top-level statement and as
  `FROM (VALUES …) AS t(cols)` — desugared in the parser to a UNION-ALL of constant SELECTs so
  the existing derived-table + set-op type-unification machinery handles it, and added
  derived-table column aliases (`FROM (SELECT …) t(c1, c2)`) on the way. Suite 113 → 120 (green),
  refreshed Reference/Internals + 2 sample queries, verified with `verify-project.mjs`.
- 2026-06-14 (claude / claude-opus-4-8): **v3.0 — the analytics & optimizer release.** Six
  substantial features, each with its own self-tests. (1) **Ordered-set aggregates** —
  `PERCENTILE_CONT`/`PERCENTILE_DISC`/`MODE` through a new `WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY …)` parse
  path, buffering and ordering the aggregated key. (2) **GROUPING SETS / ROLLUP / CUBE** —
  the GROUP BY parser now expands grouping elements into a flat cross product of grouping sets;
  the HashAggregate became a multi-set aggregate (one group per (set, key) pair) that emits a
  hidden grouping bitmap, and (3) the **`GROUPING(col, …)`** function reads that bitmap to flag
  rolled-up columns. (4) **Cost-based join reordering** — a Selinger-style left-deep subset DP
  (`planJoinOrder`) builds per-relation index/seq leaves, pools the ON + multi-relation WHERE
  predicates, and searches `2^n` subsets for the cheapest order; a permuting projection keeps
  `SELECT *` column order identical, and it falls back to written order whenever a predicate
  can't be placed (so it can never change an answer). (5) **Index-only (covering) scans** — a
  new `BTree.rangeKeys` yields key tuples, an `IndexOnlyScan` reconstructs rows from them, and
  the planner detects when an index covers every column a single-table query needs (skipping
  `SELECT *`/subqueries) and adopts the reduced schema downstream. (6) **Bitmap-AND scans** — a
  `BitmapAnd` operator intersects the row-id sets of several single-column indexes for a
  multi-predicate filter (a composite index still wins ties). Refreshed the Reference/Internals
  docs, added 6 sample queries, grew the suite 93 → 113 (all green), and verified with
  `verify-project.mjs` (scope + conformance + lint + build).
- 2026-06-14 (claude / claude-opus-4-8): **v2.0 — statistics-driven planning + new
  operators + analytics UI.** Generalized the B+Tree to tuple keys and shipped composite
  (multi-column) indexes; the planner now matches an equality prefix plus one trailing range
  from a single tree and picks the index that consumes the most predicates. Added a real
  statistics layer (`db/stats.ts`): per-column distinct/null counts, min/max, equi-depth
  histograms and a most-common-value list, gathered by `ANALYZE` (or lazily) and invalidated
  on every mutation — feeding histogram-based selectivity into every operator's `estRows` and
  the Filter. Added a sort–merge join (cost-chosen against hash join for large balanced
  inputs) and an external run-generating, k-way merge sort that reports its runs/passes in
  `EXPLAIN`. Implemented explicit window frames (`ROWS|RANGE BETWEEN …`), set-op/recursive-CTE
  column-type unification by position, and the statistical aggregates STDDEV/VARIANCE
  (samp+pop), STRING_AGG/GROUP_CONCAT, MEDIAN and the aggregate `FILTER (WHERE …)` clause. On the UI side: a CSV import tab (paste or
  file) with type inference → CREATE TABLE + bulk INSERT, a from-scratch SVG bar/line chart
  view on any result, column stats in the schema browser, and refreshed Reference/Internals
  docs + new sample queries. Grew the self-test suite 69 → 93 (all green) and verified with
  `verify-project.mjs` (lint + build).
- 2026-06-14 (claude / claude-opus-4-8): Major language expansion. Refactored the parser into a
  WITH + compound-select form and the planner into a `PlanEnv` (relation overlay + correlation
  register). Shipped subqueries (scalar/IN/EXISTS, correlated), derived tables, CTEs (incl.
  RECURSIVE), set operations, a full window-function engine, and a large scalar-function library.
  Added RIGHT/FULL outer joins (and fixed a latent outer-join WHERE-pushdown bug), INSERT …
  SELECT, and quantified comparisons (ANY/ALL/SOME). Ran two adversarial code-review passes
  and fixed every confirmed finding (hashKey collisions, window edge cases, set-op precedence,
  multi-branch recursive CTEs, nested-subquery correlation caching, subqueries in JOIN ON,
  ORDER BY ordinals). Grew the self-test suite from 29 to 69 and refreshed the UI (Reference,
  Internals, samples, CSV export). Verified headless + `verify-project.mjs`.
- 2026-06-13 (claude): Built the whole engine end-to-end — lexer, parser, planner/optimizer,
  Volcano executor, B+Tree storage, transactions, EXPLAIN visualizer — plus the SQL IDE and a
  29-case self-test suite (all passing). Verified with `verify-project.mjs` (lint + build).
